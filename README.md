## PetroleumGIS 
This page is intended to give a few examples of interactive web map applications that are easily buildable and deployable to Web/MacOS/Windows/iOS/Android applications. 

### [Satellite/Street map slider](https://petroleumgis.github.io/portfolio/slide)
This map shows an example of showing 2 maps side by side. Some use cases would be showing imagery from different time periods (Before and after), or well development between 2 time periods, or for location comparison (wells with conflicinting lat/longs).

### [Oxy/Laredo Midland Wells](https://petroleumgis.github.io/portfolio/test)
This map shows an example of wells drilled by Oxy and Laredo in Howard County in the Midland Basin. On clicking a well, attributes from the well can be retrieved such as Field name, but can be altered to retrieve any attributes from source data. 

### [Shale Play locator](https://petroleumgis.github.io/portfolio/plays)
This map shows various shale play outlines as defined by the EIA. Some use cases for this map would be to display information for map features such as State/County outlines when selected showing production/wellcounts values

### [Flyaround Map example](https://petroleumgis.github.io/portfolio/slideshow)
This is an example map which cycles between features (in this case, Borough outlines of NYC) and displays a small writeup for each as it cycles through. The map automatically pans/zooms to each area for a few seconds before going on to the next area.
