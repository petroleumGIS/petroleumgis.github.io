## PetroleumGIS 
This page is intended to give a few examples of interactive web map applications that are easily buildable and deployable to Web/MacOS/Windows/iOS/Android applications. 

### Wiper Map
This map shows an example of showing 2 maps side by side. Some use cases would be showing imagery from different time periods (Before and after), or well development between 2 time periods, or for location comparison (wells with conflicinting lat/longs).

### Oxy/Laredo Midland Wells
This map shows an example of wells drilled by Oxy and Laredo in Howard County in the Midland Basin. On clicking a well, attributes from the well can be retrieved such as Field name, but can be altered to retrieve any attributes from source data.

### Shale Play locator
This map shows various shale play outlines as defined by the EIA. The data in the hover box pulls from the source data such as well counts, production values, feature details, etc.

### Flyaround Map example
This is an example map which cycles between features (in this case, Borough outlines of NYC) and displays a small writeup for each as it cycles through. The map automatically pans/zooms to each area for a few seconds before going on to the next area.
